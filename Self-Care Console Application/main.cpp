TITLE: Self-Care Meditation and Journal Application
DESCRIPTION: For my Final Project in my Advanced Computer Programming class, I created a Self-Care Meditation and Journal Console Application. I have provided all the code
for this application. I may update this in the future to include a GUI. Along with my main.cpp file, I have provided an
additional .cpp file (Functions.cpp) and .h file (Header.h).
